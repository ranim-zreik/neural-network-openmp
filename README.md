Pragma Analysis

1.	Basic Matrix Operations: #pragma omp parallel for

This pragma appears in multiple matrix operations including:
- init_matrix_random(): Parallelizes initialization of matrix elements
- matrix_add(): Parallelizes element-wise addition
- matrix_subtract(): Parallelizes element-wise subtraction
- matrix_multiply_elementwise(): Parallelizes Hadamard product
- matrix_scale(): Parallelizes scalar multiplication
- sigmoid() and relu(): Parallelizes activation functions

These operations involve independent calculations on each matrix element, making them parallel with no data dependencies. The parallel for construct divides the iterations among available threads.

2.	 Matrix Multiplication: #pragma omp parallel for
for (int i = 0; i < A_rows; i++) {
    for (int k = 0; k < A_cols; k++) {
        double A_ik = A->data[i * A_cols + k];
        for (int j = 0; j < B_cols; j++) {
            C->data[i * B_cols + j] += A_ik * B->data[k * B_cols + j];
        }
    }
}
Matrix multiplication is computationally intensive and a performance bottleneck in neural networks. The implementation parallelizes the outer loop, assigning different rows of the result matrix to different threads. 

3.	Bias Addition in Forward Pass:
#pragma omp parallel for
for (int i = 0; i < input->rows; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < nn->layers[0].bias.cols; j++) {
        nn->layers[0].z.data[i * nn->layers[0].z.cols + j] += nn->layers[0].bias.data[j];
    }
}

Adding bias terms to each sample in a batch is parallelized across samples. Since each sample's computation is independent, this is an ideal candidate for parallelization, especially with larger batch sizes.

4.	Error Calculation with Reduction:
#pragma omp parallel
{
    double local_sum = 0.0;

    #pragma omp for
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        double error = output->data[i] - target->data[i];
        local_sum += error * error;
    }

    #pragma omp atomic
    sum_error += local_sum;
}

This implements a parallel reduction pattern for calculating mean squared error. 
Each thread:
1. Maintains a private `local_sum` variable to avoid contention
2. Processes a subset of the elements
3. Uses an atomic operation to safely update the shared sum
This approach minimizes thread synchronization while ensuring correct results.

5.	Batch Processing in Training:
#pragma omp parallel for reduction(+ : total_error) schedule(dynamic, 1)
for (int batch = 0; batch < num_batches; batch++) {
    }
This is the highest-level parallelization in the code, parallelizing across batches with:

1. reduction(+ : total_error): Safely accumulates error across threads
2. schedule(dynamic, 1): Uses dynamic scheduling with chunk size 1 to balance workload

6.	Gradient Accumulation:
#pragma omp parallel
{
    double *local_sum = (double *)calloc(nn->layers[i].delta.cols, sizeof(double));

    #pragma omp for
    for (int j = 0; j < nn->layers[i].delta.rows; j++) {
        for (int k = 0; k < nn->layers[i].delta.cols; k++) {
            local_sum[k] += nn->layers[i].delta.data[j * nn->layers[i].delta.cols + k];
        }
    }

    #pragma omp critical
    {
        for (int k = 0; k < nn->layers[i].delta.cols; k++) {
            nn->layers[i].db.data[k] += local_sum[k];
        }
    }
    free(local_sum);
}
It allocates thread-local arrays to avoid false sharing. It then parallelizes the summation across batch samples, and finally uses a critical section solely during the final gradient update phase.

7.	Weight Updates:
#pragma omp parallel for
for (int j = 0; j < weight_size; j++) {
    nn->layers[i].weights.data[j] -= lr_batch * nn->layers[i].dw.data[j];
}

Weight updates are parallelized across all weight parameters. Since each weight update is independent, this is another embarrassingly parallel operation that benefits from OpenMP parallelization.


The code uses OpenMP to parallelize independent tasks, optimize memory access, and apply reduction techniques with thread local variables. It adds parallelism at different levels element, row, and batch to improve efficiency. Overall, it balances speed and accuracy, scaling well with more threads, especially on large data.
